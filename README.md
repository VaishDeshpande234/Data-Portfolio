# Data-Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! 

### About Me

I am a results-oriented data scientist with a strong academic background and practical experience in data analysis and engineering. I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, and have hands-on experience in machine learning and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. My goal is to leverage data-driven insights to tackle complex challenges and drive strategic decision-making.

Below are details of the projects I've worked on:

## Project 1: Analysis of Electric Vehicle Registrations in Washington State

### Project Overview:
In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on electric vehicle (EV) registrations by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) each month. The analysis aimed to uncover trends, identify missing or inconsistent data, and provide insights into the adoption of electric vehicles over time.

### Key Highlights:
- **Data Overview**: This dataset shows the number of vehicles registered each month, segmented by county and vehicle type.
- **Data Quality Checks**: Identified missing values and inconsistent counts.
- **Key Findings**: Trends in EV registrations over time and by county.
- **Conclusion**: Insights into the growth of EV adoption in Washington State despite data challenges.

### Technologies Used:
- Python for data analysis and scripting.
- Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

## Project 2: Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning

### Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines based on sensor data. Predictive maintenance helps identify the point at which an engine is likely to fail, allowing for timely maintenance to prevent failures and optimize maintenance schedules.

### Key Highlights:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loaded and cleaned the training, test, and RUL datasets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Calculated RUL for the training dataset and prepared the test dataset.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trained Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LSTM models. Evaluated models using RMSE and MAE metrics.

### Technologies Used:
- Python for data analysis and scripting.
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models.
- Keras for LSTM model.

### Next Steps:
I am currently expanding my portfolio with more projects in data science and machine learning. Stay tuned for updates!
